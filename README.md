## How it works

The scripts works by doing the following:

1. Retrieve all the releases in the microsoft/vscode repo
2. For each release
   - Retrieve the Electron version in VS Code
   - Retrieve the Chromium and Node.js versions in Electron
3. Update the README file

## Running locally

1. [Install Deno](https://deno.land/#installation)
2. Create a .env file based on the .env.example file
3. Run using `deno task run`

`:bulb: If you need to update the cache provide the --no-cache flag after index.ts`
