## How it works

The scripts works by doing the following:

1. Retrieve all the releases in the microsoft/vscode repo
2. For each release
   * Retrieve the Electron version in VS Code
   * Retrieve the Chromium and Node.js versions in Electron
3. Update the README file

## Running locally

1. [Install Deno](https://deno.land/#installation)
2. Create a .env file based on the .env.example file
3. Run using the below command
```bash
deno run \
--allow-read=.env,.env.defaults,versions.json \
--allow-write=.env,.env.defaults,versions.json,README.md \
--allow-env=GITHUB_TOKEN \
--allow-net=api.github.com,raw.githubusercontent.com \
index.ts
```
`:bulb: If you need to update the cache provide the --no-cache flag after index.ts`
